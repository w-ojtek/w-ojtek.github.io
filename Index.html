      The Future Company was an entrepreneurial R&D organization dedicated to inventing bold new companies, policies, ideas, and movements to improve quality of life for people in the United States. The company was an experiment owned by its predecessor and cultural inspiration, The Future Project. The project ran out of funding in early 2019.



As founding SVP People, I led our org design, people operations workflows, and recruiting work, growing the team to 35 people in just over a year. The team was made up of researchers, analysts, designers, storytellers, strategists, entrepreneurs, and operators.



I also oversaw our pilot public policy research - the Enough project - which was a systematic examination of economic insecurity in the United States, including a feasibility assessment of various types of cash transfer programs (e.g. basic income) as a viable intervention. I'm always excited to talk shop about bold, data-driven public policy concepts. Tweet at me (@nathanielkoloc) if you'd like a copy of the Enough report!
